To become roulette God you must follow steps under:
1. Go to economy channel/s
2. Go to "search" (Above users list)
3. Enter text - ball
4. Look at bot messages with last ball drops

Playing when ball wasn't even not 3 times in row is not recomended and NOT concluded it this guide; Most of results are positive when there hasn't been 4 times at place.

Ball drop list and what to pick when so:
Ball is at red 3+ times in row - black
Ball is at black 3+ times in row - red
Ball was not 3+ in row times at 1-12 - 1-12 (3x multipler)
Ball was not 3+ in row times at 13-24 - 13-24 (3x multipler)
Ball was not 3+ in row times at 25-36 - 25-36 (3x multipler)

There may be situation there were ex. black, red, black, red in last balls then you may also try 1st 2nd and 3rd option (Check roulette-info to check what number are in 1st 2nd or 3rd):
Ball was not 3+ in row times at 1st - 1st (3x multipler)
Ball was not 3+ in row times at 2nd - 2nd (3x multipler)
Ball was not 3+ in row times at 3rd - 3rd (3x multipler)

EXTRA DROPS:
1. If there is situatuon fx. black, red, black, red then pick last colour, WARNING! Works ONLY if that situation is on 3+ ; Good example: red black red black (Next drop black) ; Bad example: red black (Next drop cant be picked)
More will be added soon...
